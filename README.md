# Locafy — Local Business Discovery & Listings

## Problem Statement

The objective of Locafy, a web platform, is to help local businesses register and present their services, to enable residents to discover, review, and to contact those businesses.
The system must support distinct user roles (business owners, customers, administrators), provide searchable, image-rich business profiles, and ensure secure, maintainable deployment (Spring Boot backend, Spring Security, Docker). 
The project will evaluate three architectural approaches — monolithic, containerized (modular), and microservices — and compare them based on deployment complexity, scalability, data consistency, and operational cost.

## Functionalities:

1. Registration & Login:
- Implement user registration and authentication functionalities.
- Ensure secure storage of user data and sensitive information.
- Provide a seamless and user-friendly registration process.
- Supports three distinct roles: Business Owners, Customers, and Administrators.
- Role-based access is securely managed using Spring Security.

2. Business Listing Management
- Business owners can create and manage business profiles.
- Upload storefront and service-related images/ contact information/ location/ business website details

3. Intelligent Business Discovery
   - Customers can search, filter, and explore local businesses.
   - Detailed business pages display images, descriptions, services, ratings, and reviews.
     
4. Profile & Interaction
- Dedicated profile pages for both businesses and customers.
- Customers can review, favorite, and contact businesses directly.
